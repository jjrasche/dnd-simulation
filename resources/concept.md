# Concept

Create a framework to build a character and express that characters metrics. 


## Purpose
To compare different builds or changes/choices made to a build.

Eventually, build an algorithm for inputing desired metrics and outputting specific builds that meet those metrics

Outcome simulator. Given two groups determine who would win.

## Plan
Use the encounter idea as a way to test both:
static metrics: a build's impact on an encounter when other builds cannot interact with it
- this method will use probabilities and averages to understand statistical advantages between builds
and 
dynamic outcomes: a build's impact on an encounter given other builds turn by turn interaction with it
- with this method builds action's will have a chance based definitive outcome on the encounter
- the actions of other builds in the encounter will modify both the environemnt and builds engaged in the encounter
